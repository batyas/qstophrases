'''
Convert questions to phrases, in order to create a dataset of phrases and associated answers from a question-answer dataset.

(Code is written for use with SQuAD dataset -- it fixes certain mistakes in original SQuAD questions, and the main function parses a json file
written in SQuAD format. 
However, the code can easily be adapted to convert another dataset, 
or can be used to convert individual questions by passing them into the "choose method" function.)

*** NOTE: If using python 3.7 (on a Mac computer) - in order to install the pattern library, 
run “brew install mysql”
“export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/mysql/bin”
"pip install mysqlclient"
"pip install pattern"

Then, in the local installation of pattern, change line 609 of pattern->text->_init_.py from raise StopIteration to return

(if using python 3.6, pattern installation will work without modifying code)

*** to install spacy library used in this code, run "python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg"
